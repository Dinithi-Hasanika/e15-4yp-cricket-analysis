## Abstract
Cricket is a two-team game which was originated in south-east England and developed globally in the 19th century. This world's second most popular game is played for a limited number of overs as twenty20 for twenty overs and ODI(One Day International) matches for 50 overs. Test matches are played for five days. Due to the availability of ball-by-ball data of this bat-and-ball game, researchers were able to do statistical analysis of data for pattern recognition, to find factors affecting the game and for outcome prediction of a match. But due to the high uncertainty of the game, it has become very difficult to come up with a stable and accurate model for the predictions. Outcome model also depends on the number of overs, match type, considering time period and players combination. This research focus only the ODI matches and considering only the ICC full members; England, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, Zimbabwe, West Indies, Afghanistan, South Africa  and Ireland. This outcome prediction is based on players performances in a team and some features specific to the team and the match. The individual performance of batsmen, bowlers and fielders are analysed separately considering all-time ODI data. Combined performance of batsmen and bowlers were analysed and compared with individual performances using statistical method. Association rule mining method was used to find frequent winning player combinations. Match data from 2015 to 2020 were considered for the combined performance analysis and outcome prediction. For all these predictions we use data mining and machine learning techniques.

\section{Player Performance}
Each cricket team is a combination of batsmen, bowlers, fielders, and all-rounders including the wicket-keeper(primarily a batsman~\cite{passi2018increased}). For the winnability of the team, individual batsmen should score maximum runs, individual bowlers should take the maximum wickets possible while restricting the opponent team from scoring either by runs or offering extras. For the victory, the wicket keeper should also contribute as a batsman, other than playing behind the wickets~\cite{Performa13:online}. All-rounders contribute by scoring runs and taking wickets since they have the ability of both batting and bowling. Fielders should contribute to the team by getting the batsmen out of the game or by limiting the scoring of batsmen.

Individual playersâ€™ performance has a significant impact on the winnability of a cricket team. So, the accurate metrics that affect the winnability of a specific team should be found to evaluate the individual players. The basis of modeling the strength of a team is enhancing the strength of batting and bowling of individual players~\cite{agarwal2017cricket}. Many researchers have analyzed different methods for this player performance evaluation, and the below sections will go through them.
